I've been on <a href="http://twitter.com/zaphar">twitter</a> for a while now andam currently up to 1789 posts. I'm a snippet twitterer. I typically don't try to connect tweets to previous tweets, but I'm fascinated by the people who do. <a href="http://twitter.com/brentspiner">Brent Spiner</a> for instance is at this moment twittering a saga of two women in chunks of 140 characters or less. I'm actually somewhat on the edge of my seat. Which is pretty decent for twittering. Perhaps I should consider doing some saga's of my own. First though I'll need to have something saga worthy happen to me.
