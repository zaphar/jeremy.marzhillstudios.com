Have you ever wished your CMS seamlessly handled multiple types of content and multiple ways of organizing, storing, and presenting them? Well so have I. So now after 2 years of working on Bricklayer off and on I'm finally going to build something useful with it. I'm a man with many interests and I'd like to store and share them all. MetaBase will be designed with that in mind. Whether it's an image, essay, diary entry, or tutorial or howto, MetaBase will handle it and display it in an appropriate way. It will also allow me to manage it using such exciting technologies as metadata, tagging, and hiearchical ranking. This should be fun.
