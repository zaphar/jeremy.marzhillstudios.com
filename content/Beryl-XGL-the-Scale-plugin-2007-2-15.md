A particularly handy feature of Beryl is the Scale Plugin. This plugin gives an easy intuitive way to select the window you want to switch to on a busy desktop. It can be activated by setting a hotspot or using a hotkey. It takes all the open windows and tiles them in the screen scaling them to fit so you can pick the window you want to switch to easily. It also displays those windows in realtime so video keeps playing commandline console text keeps scrolling and so on. Here is a screenshot of this feature = "<a class="imagelink" href="http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/Scale.png" title="Beryl Scale Plugin"><img id="image120" src="http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/Scale.thumbnail.png" alt="Beryl Scale Plugin" /></a>"
