For two reasons. One it will make capturing a static backup of my site easier in the future using a tool like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html">wget</a>. Two I'm using a new analytics tool and this will help me track visitor traffic in much more meaningful ways. I don't think any links you might have saved before will stop working but just in case it does... Now you know why.
