I've tried all those development process programs and tools. UML, Case Tools, Flowcharting. You name it I've investigated. Just part of my nature I guess. I like new toys and investigating or learning about new things. When it comes to serious development work though I've really only found one process that works for me. <strong>Just Code It.</strong> I start creating the structure of my app. Code the Class and Object definitions. Identify the needed functions. While doing this I write pseudocode in the form of comments in these structures. Then I start coding. It's a highly iterative process but it works for me and makes me far more productive than anything else I've found. I also tend to write Black Box code. Each of the pieces has a clear way of being used and each can be coded without knowing the internals of the other pieces. This way I can test and code each piece easily without having to worry about the rest of the app. I'm not sure what you'd call this process. It bares some similarity to Agile or Extreme programming processes I suppose but really it's just an extension of the way I think. So... What's your development process?
