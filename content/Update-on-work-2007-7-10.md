So I'm finally starting to get settled at the new job and I thought I'd let folks know how things are going. I'm liking the SCRUM Process for development and the AGILE emphasis here. I'm also finding a surprising number of ways to contribute. So far I've been useful in helping with resolving SVN branching conflicts. Developing an XML Schema. And Javascript Library standardization recommendations. In fact I may be doing some roundtable Dev learning sessions in the next month or so on some of those topics for the other devs which should be fun. I have some pending articles on here to finish up and some features to release for Bricklayer and Metabase when I get some time to do so. Which means this space should soon be experiencing some more activity.
