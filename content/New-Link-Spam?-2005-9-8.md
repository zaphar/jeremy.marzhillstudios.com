Has anyone noticed spurious referrer's showing up in your website logs? I have noticed strange referrer's showing up. It's looking like they were using bogus referrals to get their link on my log page to bump their google rating. I've now removed my logs link from the sidebar and added /logs/ to the robots.txt file so it won't benefit them anymore. But it was still annoying. Has anyone else noticed this kind of thing before?
