Now don't get me wrong. I really like the wordpress UI for posting and managing pages and posts and comments and spam. However they are sadly sadly lacking in the templating department. I have discovered this in the last few days after attempting to modify a template. I really dislike the way it all works. You aren't templating your coding in PHP. and it's a little obtuse that way. It's probably just a matter of preference. Perhaps I should right a templating plugin. If that's possible. I wonder.....?
