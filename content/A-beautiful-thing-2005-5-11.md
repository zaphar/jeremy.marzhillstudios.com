One of the beautiful things about web app's is the install. There is none. Nothing. Of course web apps aren't the only thing with that feature. I hear, although have not verified, that OS X's instal process for applicationsl is as simple as copying a folder over. Many open source applications are the same. copy a folder or a binary and your done. No editing the registry. No registering services. <strong>No <em>mess.</em></strong> The uninstall? Just as easy.... delete the folder. Web apps are perhaps a little superior in the uninstall department. Just don't go back to the page. No install means no uninstall either. No registry corruption. No forgotten registry entries hanging around clogging your machine. No services left behind. <strong>No <em>mess.</em></strong> Computers are supposed to make your life easier not harder. And Web apps are just one more way of doing that.
