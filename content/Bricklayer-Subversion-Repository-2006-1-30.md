I have finished moving my bricklayer subversion source code repository to a public location. you can find it at the following link. If your browser recognizes the svn protocol you can just click the link below. For all others you'll need to copy the link location into a subversion browser of some sort. Now you can get the cutting edge copy :-) enjoy!! <a href="svn://marzhillstudios.com/repos/bricklayer/Current">BrickLayer Subversion Repository</a>
