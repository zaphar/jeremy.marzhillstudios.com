I am slowly getting some of my old article's back up and online. You will start to see them in the links under pages on the sidebar. As I determine they are useful or helpful I will put them back up. The first is [Perl and CGI part I](@./Perl-and-CGI-part-I-2005-5-4.md) I really should do part II of that one I suppose :-)
