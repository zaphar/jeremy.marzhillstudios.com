In an earlier post about "<a href="http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/?p=18">that guy</a>" who can get you what you need I asked if you were the information hookup for you family, friends, and coworkers. If you are then you have probably noticed something. When the company recognizes how useful you are in that respect, you will never be left alone. It becomes a part of your unofficial job description. Saying no is just about not an option. This can get difficult. If you are lucky you will find an opportunity, in a mandate from upper managment to work on a project. You have just found a gold mine. Mine it for all it's worth. When it runs dry you'll wish you still had it. This particular mine yeilds the highly coveted "power to say no". You have an intensive job to do and it takes precedence. The information seekers will have to wait. Enjoy it while it lasts because when the project is over the avalanche will continue.
