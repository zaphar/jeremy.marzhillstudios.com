Hello there,

I haven't updated this blog in over two years. That's a long time for something on the internet. I still get traffic for various articles though so I figured I should probably get back into the swing of things.

I've been working at Google as some of you may already know. I also still do a lot of hacking in my spare time. Lately most of it has been in [Go](http://golang.org). But I do the occasional thing in Javascript, Erlang, and Haskell as well.

So lets take stock shall we?

* Latest Projects:
  * http://code.google.com/p/go-html-transform/ a css3 selector html scraper and transformation library for Go.
  * http://code.google.com/p/gomonitor/ a timeseries database written in Go.
* Revamped this blog's html and css. I do hope the colors and  typography are better. I'll be continuing to tweak it over the next few weeks.
* Teaching some classes in Downtown chicago for friends.

I hope to write some articles about Go soon as well. The first will probably be about go-html-transform.

I've also been heavily active in church. We attend [FBC Lansing](http://fbclansing.org) now. It's a healthy church and I now serve on the Deacon board as well as teaching Sunday School and Youth Bible study.
