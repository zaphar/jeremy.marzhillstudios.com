Beryl has a feature called Grouping and Tabbing. It's a way to organize windows on your desktop to save space. And as promised I have screenshots demonstrating the feature. This first one shows the tabbed group with the tab selection popup. <a class="imagelink" href="http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/TabbedWindowsBig.png" title="BerylTabbing"><img id="image115" src="http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/TabbedWindowsBig.thumbnail.png" alt="BerylTabbing" /></a> You can choose your animation when switching tabs just like anything else in Beryl. Here is a screenshot of the rotation animation when switching tabs. <a class="imagelink" href="http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/SwitchingTabsBig.png" title="Switching Tabs in a Tabbed Group"><img id="image116" src="http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/SwitchingTabsBig.thumbnail.png" alt="Switching Tabs in a Tabbed Group" /></a> Stay tuned for more screenshots as I identify features that I think are worth highlighting. Next will be some transparency examples and window thumbnailing.
