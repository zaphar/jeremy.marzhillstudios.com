I've revamped and rewritten the Bricklayer documentation to reflect some significant changes to the API. You can get it off the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bricklayer-perl">Sourceforge site</a> or <a href="http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/bricklayer/BKManual/">browse it online here</a> using the link on the menu. Please let me know if you find any errors in spelling grammar or the API description. Also if there is any additional information you might want included in it.
