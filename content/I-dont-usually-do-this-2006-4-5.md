But I have clients on Network Solutions and they must have just about the worst service I've ever seen for DNS. and to top it off their servers go down way to often for the price they charge. <a href="http://isc.sans.org/diary.php?n&storyid=1238">Case In Point</a> That was just the latest outage. So if any of you are thinking of getting DNS or Domain Names from them. Don't. Just a warning but I really haven't been impressed by them.
