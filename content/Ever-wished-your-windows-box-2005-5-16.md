Ever wished your windows box... could email you when certain events happened? It has an eventlog why can't it just email when it sees an event occur? Well I decided it was time to add just that functionality. So.. . I proudly present <a href="http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/EventNotifier.zip">EventNotifierV2.pl</a>. A script that checks your windows eventlog for events and emails you when it sees them. Surely someone else has a need for this.
