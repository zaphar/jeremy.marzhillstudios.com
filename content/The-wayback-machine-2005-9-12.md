Apparently some German Scholar was made aware of a very old article I wrote a while back. It is featured in his german paper at a university here. I'm not sure what he was saying about it but it is interesting nonetheless. You can learn alot by looking at what google. has to say about you. <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=27&url=http%3A//www2.ikg.uni-bonn.de/kolbe/diplomarbeiten/Diplomarbeit_Michael_Homoet.pdf&ei=5yAmQ_KLF6PUigGvrrmRDg">Diplomarbeit_Michael_Homoet</a> wonder what it says. anyone care to translate page 65 of this for me? I really have to dig that old article up somewhere. <strong>Update = "SeptemberT12, 2005 @ 09:55</strong> The old article is located here. <a href="http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/programming/archives/cat_php.html">http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/programming/archives/cat_php.html</a> I'll see about moving to the site later."
