Beryl allows you to do realtime transparency and thumbnailing with windows. The following screenshot demonstrates these capabilities. There is a video playing underneath a transparent window and also playing on the thumbnail of the window over the taskbar. Unfortunately you can not see the video actually playing in the thumbnail and underneath the transparent window so you'll have to take my word for it. Its a powerful demonstration of how powerful the Beryl/XGL architecture can be. <a class="imagelink" href="http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/ThumnailingAndTransparency.png" title="Transparency and Thumbnailing"><img id="image118" src="http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/ThumnailingAndTransparency.thumbnail.png" alt="Transparency and Thumbnailing" /></a>
