and of course being the bright young google lover I am I added it to my gmail client. you can now reach me using the jabber protocol, my gmail username, and google's new talk service. No sorry Gaim doesn't support the voice portion but my voice isn't that spectacular anyway. So what are you waiting for? get on the google bandwagon and contact me on google's talk service.
