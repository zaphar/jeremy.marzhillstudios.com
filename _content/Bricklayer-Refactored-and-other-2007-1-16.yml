Bricklayer has been heavily refactored for more modularity. You can see the much changed codebase at the new <a href="http://bricklayer-perl.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bricklayer-perl/Current/">svn repository</a> Instructions for SVN Checkout can be found here: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=173287">SourceForge SVN Checkout</a> Current is the trunk branch in the repository tree structure. Documentation and some examples for the new API will be forthcoming shortly. Including the new DataBase Access API concept I will be introducing. A preview of the proof of concept code is in the Bricklayer/Data libraries directory.
