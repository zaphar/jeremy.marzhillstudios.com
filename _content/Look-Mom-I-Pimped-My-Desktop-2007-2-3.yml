Thanks to the wonders of open source. I now have a fully OpenGL Accelerated Desktop. Complete with realtime window opacity, An Expose like interface a totally awesome task switcher, wobbling windows, Window animations. But the totally blow me away feature was window thumbnailing. if I have a video running and minimize the window then hover over it in the task bar then the thumbnail shows the running video!! I'm like a kid in a candy store. Now most people would be like sure who cares but the task switcher and Expose like feature are incredibly useful. Beryl and XGL Rock!!! Screenshots to come.
