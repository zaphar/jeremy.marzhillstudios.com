If you have always wanted the functionality of GNU Screen for your win32 box but couldn't get the win32 port to do the detach/reattach portion correctly then your not alone. And thanks to the power of open source <a href="http://dtach.sourceforge.net/">some guy created a stripped down version</a> called dtach that doesn't have all the fancy stuff. This version just so happens to compile and run perfectly on cygwin. It might even do it correctly on just a mingw32 setup. What this means is that you can now run detached terminal sessions on your windows box. I've provided the binary for you to use if you're interested. <a href="http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/dtach.exe">dtach</a> <a href="http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/dtach.lnk">Example shortcut to use it</a>
