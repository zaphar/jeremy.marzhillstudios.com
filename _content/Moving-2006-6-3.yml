Moving makes me a little on edge like a cat. I feel like I'm flying around like a fledgling lost in a sea of boxes. I'll go batty if we don't clear out our dining room soon. (That's where all the boxes are kept.) <a href="http://julie.marzhillstudios.com/index.php/general/critter-corner/">Confused?</a> <strong>Ack, my blog has been hijacked!</strong> HA HA!!! don't worry folks it's just my wife playing a joke on me. :-)
