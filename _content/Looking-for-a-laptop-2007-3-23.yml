I'm in the market for a laptop. I'm either going to be buying a refurbished Mac. Or I'm going to buy a laptop certified for linux. What I want in a laptop if I get a linux one is: already installed and configured wifi. Nvidia graphics chipset with dedicated memory at least a dvd drive dvdrw preferred at least 512mb of memor 1gb preferred at least 80 gb hdd 100 perferred 10/100 ethernet port If anyone has recommendations or even one to sell let me know. Addendum: I have purchased the laptop. I bought a sony Viao VGN AR320E.
