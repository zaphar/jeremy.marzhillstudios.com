I am slowly getting some of my old article's back up and online. You will start to see them in the links under pages on the sidebar. As I determine they are useful or helpful I will put them back up. The first is <a href="http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/?page_id=8">Perl and CGI part I</a> I really should do part II of that one I suppose :-)
