## Scala Tutorial:

* Speaker: Dean Wampler
* Really informative overview of Scala.
* Notes
   * Type inference
   * Concise
      * No boilerplate
      * User defined factory methods
   * Templated classes
   * Objects as Functions
      * And vice versa
   * Classes:
      * fields are private by default
      * var keyword generates getters and setters (uniform access principle)
      * case classes provide helpers for structural classes
   * Traits:
      * Interface + optional Implementation
      * Templatable
      * Construction time mixin of traits using with keyword
      * Traits in Scala are order dependent
   * object = singleton class
      * constructed at the definition
   * misc
      * Unit ~~ Void
   * Akka scala actor library
