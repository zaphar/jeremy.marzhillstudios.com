Iterate*!* is my Scrum style project management tool. Inspired by my dislike
for XPlanners UI. Iterate*!* was started about a month ago and is coded in
[erlang](http://erlang.org/) using
[mochiweb](http://code.google.com/p/mochiweb/), and
[nitrogen](http://nitrogenproject.com/). Kick the tires and whatnot if you
want to see it in action: http://iterate.marzhillstudios.com:8001/
