I'm not sure how useful this actually is but you can't deny that it's pretty cool. May I present to you the Cube: <a class="imagelink" href="http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/Cube3D_Windows.png" title="Desktop Cube"><img id="image122" src="http://jeremy.marzhillstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/Cube3D_Windows.thumbnail.png" alt="Desktop Cube" /></a> Now, like all the things Beryl can do, this is in realtime so you can watch progress bars move, text scroll, and movies play all while rotating your cube.
