I've noticed something today. I can make Tech Support ladies laugh. I'm quite good at it. I've had to talk to a number of tech support folks recently and they've all been women. I don't know why but it comes in handy. If you make them laugh they are much nicer when trying to help you. Now if my wife is reading this don't worry. I'm not flirting.... <em>much</em>.
