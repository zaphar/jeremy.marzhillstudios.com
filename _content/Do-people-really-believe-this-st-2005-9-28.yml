<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,170724,00.html">FOXNews.com - Views - Massachusetts Should Close Down OpenDocument</a> Man the litany of folks not getting it just keeps growing and growing. I'm going to say this one more time. Open Source is here to stay. Get over it and start learning how to do business in the new environment. And if someone can explain how Massachusets choosing an Open Document "<em>Standard</em>" kills competition I'd like to know. I mean surely letting non microsoft providers bid on government contracts would <strong>increase</strong> not decrease competition. And no one said microsoft couldn't offer the document format themselves. Microsoft created this environment now they can sink or swim with the rest of us in it.
