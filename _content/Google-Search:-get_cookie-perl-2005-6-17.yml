Somehow my very own tutorial on perl and CGI has made it to the top of the google search heap. I don't know how long it will stay there so I thought I'd bask while I could: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=get_cookie+perl&#038;sourceid=mozilla-search&#038;start=0&#038;start=0&#038;ie=utf-8&#038;oe=utf-8&#038;client=firefox-a&#038;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">Google Search: get_cookie perl</a> Guess I really do have to write part two of that thing now. I'm also on page two of a google search for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=perl+cookies+keys&hl=en&hs=hoi&lr=&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&start=10&sa=N">perl cookies keys</a>" I found these by perusing my logs. You can find some interesting things out by looking at those
