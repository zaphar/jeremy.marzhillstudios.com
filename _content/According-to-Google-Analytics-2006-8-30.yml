The subject that drives the most interesting traffic to this site is Apache2 with mod_perl2 questions. To that end after I finish this major software project on a mod_perl platform I intend to write up a more detailed tutorial on actually using mod_perl2 in a production environment and what it can do for you. So watch this space :-) I'll be done with the project before too long.
