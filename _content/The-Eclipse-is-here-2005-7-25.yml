Eclipse 3.1 has been released. I am a big fan of Eclipse. It is quite possibly the best all around IDE for developers out there. It may be a bit slow compared to a non java app, but has all the features you need. <ul> <li>It handles pretty much every language you can think of.</li> <li>Works on most every platform.</li> <li> Supports multiple versioning systems out of the box.</li> <li>Has built in debugging support. Including a lot of great features for the web developer. Like running a web server process with the ability to step through your code.</li> </ul> What more can you ask for. The Eclipse GUI interface (SWT) is significantly faster than its java counterparts also. I'd highly recommend taking it for a spin. It even supports a sophisticated update and patch downloading system to make keeping it up to date easy. That's something a lot of Open Source systems are lacking lately.
